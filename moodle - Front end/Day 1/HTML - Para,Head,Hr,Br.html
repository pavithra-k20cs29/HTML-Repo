    <p> A flower is the bloom or blossom of a plant. The flower is the part of a plant that produces seeds, which in time become other flowers. This is thanks to a process called pollination that is carried out either by insects or the wind. Every type of flower is different, in colour, smell, shape and size.</p>
        <br><p> Flowers need food and sunlight to survive, as they make their own food/energy through photosynthesis.There are so many different species of flowers in the world no one knows an exact number, but the closest estimate is somewhere between 250,000 and 400,000 species.</p>
