    <p> Hi guys, as I have seen that everybody has come in this forum to post their experience of their college life. Yes, I do have come with a motive of explaining my story as I have gone through it in the past. It was the end of summer when, rainy season was going to start. I was far way from my home at my native place gone for summer holidays. Our results date of S.S.C. (Std. 10th) have been announced for the 22nd of June. I was waiting for the day to come as it was one of the great day for me. My return ticket was for the date of 22nd only. So I was not able to know about the status of the result. On 23rd the schools were having holiday that's why I was not able to view on that day also. Then when the day of 24th come, I hurriedly rushed to the school with my parents. One notice board was standing just below the school. I saw my name in that list. This list was made for the students who passes first class. I was very happy to see my name there. Then after that I collected my result, and I have got 86% for S.S.C. Now all my friends, were rushing for admissions in the college.  one day he suddenly tell me to prepared for an admission at the Government arts college in udumalpet. I joined as a Computer science student and successfully starts my college life . Finallly got passed without any arrears and got overall 83% and passed out on 2023.  </p>
