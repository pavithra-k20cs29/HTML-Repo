    <p style="color: blueviolet;"> Hi!! I'm Pavithra .A quote by Marva Collins states, “success does not come to you, you go to it.” This is exactly how I look at my success. My definition of success is being happy and doing what you love. The only way I can achieve this goal is by receiving an education, saving money, and picking a career path that I will enjoy. I work hard in school to be prepared for when I go off to college, which will eventually lead me to a career. Another plan of mine is to save as much money as I can before college and apply for many scholarships, so I can graduate from college with as little debt as possible. I set these goals myself, however, none of these goals could be possible without the support from my family. My mom has been my guide through all of my schooling and part-time jobs. She lets me know which classes in high school to take. Her success in life pushes me to want to be successful and do well at everything. This is why I try so hard at school. During my mom time in a day she worked two jobs and took advanced classes for her better knowledge.  I decided I wanted to push myself like her and work two jobs while taking several college courses.</p>
